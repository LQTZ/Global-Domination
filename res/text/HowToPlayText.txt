Global Domination is a turn-based strategy game where players take turns to attempt to dominate the “world,” a 5 by 5 hex grid. The objective of the game is to fight and eliminate all other players.

Each hexagonal tile in the grid is a territory whereupon a city can be built and units can reside. Soldier units are used to fight other units, and settler units are used to build cities. On each turn, players have the option to perform unit actions and/or grow a unit. 

Unit actions include moving a certain number of tiles, attacking other units, and building cities.

To perform these actions:

 * First select them by clicking on the tile the unit is on and clicking the unit you wish to order under the unit list. (You cannot select units of other nationalities.)

 * To order a unit to move, select it, click the “Move” button, and click on the adjacent tile you wish to move the unit to. Units can only move a certain number of times in a turn; this number can be viewed in the “Selected Unit Info” pane.

 * To order a unit to attack another unit (only applicable to soldier units), click the “Attack” button, click the tile with the enemy unit(s) you wish to attack. Each fight will do some amount of damage to the health of both units fighting. When units run out of health points, they die. The outcome of fights depend on the units’ levels and some luck. Units will automatically attack the weakest units that are not in their nation. When you have killed all enemy units on an enemy city, the tile becomes neutral.

 * To order a unit to build a city (only applicable to settler units), navigate the unit to the tile on which you want to build the city using the Move order, and click the “Settle” button. Building the city will take multiple turns. If the settlers are killed by enemies while building the city, the city is deleted.

To grow a unit, select the tile and click the “Grow” button, and popups will appear guiding you through the process

To do game-wide actions, select the background and three buttons will appear.

 * The “Next” button ends your turn.
 
 * The “Save” button saves the game.
 
 * The “Exit” button exits the game WITHOUT SAVING.

At the beginning of the game, each player starts with a single settler, and nothing else. The settler must build a city. The cities grow soldier and settler units. The military units are strategically used to attack other players. The settlers are used to build new cities to grow more units. Players must strategically balance their fighting with building (or capturing) of new cities to grow new units. The game ends when one player has destroyed all the units of the other players.
