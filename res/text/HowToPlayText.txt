Global Domination is a strategy-based game where players take turns to attempt to dominate the world, which is essentially a 5 by 5 grid of hexagons. Each hexagon represents a territory that can be dominated. Each hexagon tile has an assigned revenue value, which is how much money a city on that tile will earn. In order to win, you have to take control of every city on the board and eliminate the opposing forces. On each move, a player has the option to establish a settlement, move their units, upgrade a city, upgrade units,or attack another city.
 
In the beginning, each player starts with one settler, nothing else. The settler’s job is to establish a settlement on a city. Once the city is established, the person who owns the city can train troops and earn a fixed amount of money each turn. The cities can be upgraded to train more troops per turn.

Now, we can talk about the battle concept of the game. Cities can train various troops to fight for the owner of that city. Troops can also be upgraded to become more powerful in battle. When a player attacks the city of another player, the odds of them winning will be displayed. This can be used to strategically plan attacks and defeat the opposing forces.
